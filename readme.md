# Quantum Engineer of UI Chaos & Transactional Reveries

I once accidentally shorted the DOM and caused a margin call in three time zones. My React components are entangled across multiversal branches, and my webpack config has achieved sentience (it mostly screams). Everything is lazy-loaded, including my sense of reality. Production is a myth. I deploy only into dreams. If you see a blinking div on the S&P500, thatâ€™s probably me pushing to prod during a lunar eclipse.
